### **Mac Installation**

1. Install Homebrew, a terminal-based package manager. If you haven't yet
    installed Homebrew, you can do so [here](https://brew.sh/).
2. Run `brew update` to update Homebrew.
3. Run `brew install node`.
4. Check that you have both `node` and `npm` installed by running

        node -v
        npm -v

### **Setting Up Local Development Environment**

To start the server on a local port, run (in the src/ directory)
        npm install
        npm run build
        npm run start

Then, in your browser, go to the localhost URL.
